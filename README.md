Building collaborative geo-datasets using GitHub and geojson.io
=============

Learn GeoJSON is a project to learn about the GeoJSON data format using git, GitHub, and geojson.io. It can be taught as a standalone exercise, or can be used to build real live collaborative datasets! There are a few in here to get you started. 

The following sections are intended for absolute beginners. If you'e an intermediate or advanced user, great! Skip to the section where you're having trouble or need instructions.

## Background

### What is this project?

The goal of this project is to build an awesome, collaborative map, showing off cool places, generated by the people who live in those places. It uses git for version control, GitHub to house the data, and provides editing examples using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io), a great tool for editing GeoJSON files.

### What is GeoJSON?

[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) is an open and popular geographic data format commonly used in web applications. It is an extension of a format called [JSON](http://json.org), which stands for *JavaScript Object Notation*. Basically, JSON is a table turned on its side. GeoJSON extends JSON by adding a section called "geometry" such that you can define coordinates for the particular object (point, line, polygon, multi-polygon, etc). A point in a GeoJSON file might look like this:

    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -122.65335738658904,
          45.512083676585156
        ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "name": "Hungry Heart Cupcakes",
        "address": "1212 SE Hawthorne Boulevard",
        "website": "http://www.hungryheartcupcakes.com",
        "gluten free": "no"
      }
    }
    
GeoJSON files have to have both a `"geometry"` section and a `"properties"` section. The `"geometry"` section houses the geographic information of the feature (its location and type) and the `"properties"` section houses all of the descriptive information about the feature (like fields in an attribute table).

### What are git and GitHub?

[Git](http://git-scm.org) is a tool that allows multiple people to work on the same files at the same time without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes. This general concept is called *version control*, and git is a *version control system*. There are several other version control systems out there, but git is popular because it does its job more efficiently than many (if not all) of the others.

In order for multiple people to work on a project, the data has to live in a place where multiple people can access it. [GitHub](http://github.com) is one of those places: the site houses thousands and thousands of projects, in individual workspaces called *repositories*, or *repos*, that multiple people can access, copy, edit, and update using the tools available via git. (Guess what: You're inside of a repo right now!) These repositories also have a tracking element; when someone makes a change to a project, or a *commit*, information is stored about the user, the time, the exact changes that were made (all the way down to the individual line inside the file!), and a unique ID that allows the project owner to restore back to that particular moment.

### Why are we using GitHub and GeoJSON?

[Tom MacWright](http://www.mapbox.com/about/team/#tom-macwright) over at [MapBox](http://mapbox.com) has built an amazing, browser-based tool for editing GeoJSON files called [geojson.io](http://geojson.io). Using some of the great tools available via [MapBox.js](http://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v1.3.1/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com), and some [internal GitHub functionality](https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that), geojson.io allows users to easily edit and create geographic data in the browser.

## The Basics

### Awesome! How do I contribute?

There are a few things that are required for you to contribute to this dataset. First of all, you need to make yourself a GitHub account, if you don't have one already. It's free and easy to set up, and should take less than five minutes.

I would also advise downloading [git](http://git-scm.org). Click the link and download the recommended version.

Beyond that, there are two main ways to contribute to this dataset: one is to **edit existing files** by adding points to them. The other is to **add your own files** to the repository and make them available for editing. There are step-by-step instructions for doing each of these, below.

## Editing Existing Files

These are the files that are currently in the repository and can be edited:

  - [pdxplaces.geojson](https://github.com/lyzidiamond/learn-geojson/blob/master/pdxplaces.geojson): Cool places in Portland (dummy dataset for practice)

*Note: opening files from GitHub in geojson.io is currently not working unless you are in Chrome and have the geojson.io extension. The following instructions are for Chrome users.*

1. If you haven't done so yet, get yourself a [GitHub](http://github.com) account and download [git](http://git-scm.org).
2. Download the [geojson.io Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geojsonio/oibjgofbhldcajfamjganpeacipebckp). This will allow you to click through directly from your GeoJSON file to geojson.io.
3. Once you're all logged in to your GitHub account, navigate over to the [learn-geojson](http://github.com/lyzidiamond/learn-geojson) repo and press the button at the top that says Fork. *Forking* a repo makes a copy of it that is all yours. Head on over to github.com/[yourusername]/learn-geojson. This is your copy of the repo!
4. In your copy, click through to the file you want to edit. You should see a nice little map showing the points in the dataset. Just for fun, click on one of the points. A popup appears with attribute information for the point! Neat, huh?
5. Click the little button that says geojson.io. The GeoJSON file is now open and editable in geojson.io.
6. Add a point. Add some attributes for that point.
7. Notice that above your "attribute table" there's a little button that says "</> JSON" on it. Go ahead and click on that.
8. This is GeoJSON! Take a look at the last point in the list. It's the one you just created! Each of your attributes is in the "properties" section, and there are coordinates for where you placed the point housed in the "geometry" section. So really, what you're doing is adding some lines of code to a .geojson file! This will be important later.
9. Add as many more points as you want. Seriously. Go to town.
10. When you're done adding points, click Save on the top bar. A small box appears asking for a "Commit message." Type in a short description of the points you added and press Commit.
11. Once you've done that, a little box pops up in the same area that says, "Changes committed to GitHub:" followed by a series of numbers and letters. Click on the numbers/letters.
12. This is a list of all of the commits for the repository. This list will include not only the commits you've made, but also all of the commits that were made to the dataset before you forked it.
13. Click on the number/letter combination for your most recent commit.
